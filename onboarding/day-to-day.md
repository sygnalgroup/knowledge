# Day to day

### Stand-up daily meeting

We have the standuply.com app to simulate a daily standup. It'll ask you three questions
every business day at 10h30am GMT-3.

The questions are:

What did you do yesterday?
What do you plan on doing today?
Okay, any obstacles?

You should respond the first two questions with bullet points, feel free to be as descriptive as you may like.

### Asana

Go to our Assana current sprint project, get one task from the To Do list, assign it to you, move it to Doing list. After finishing it, move it to PR column and add the PR link to it. When your PR is approved, merge it and move to Done.
